Cosmos supports running on any Intel x86 environment. However for debugging
and ease of use, many virtual and physical setups have integrated support. If
you do not see your environment, this does not mean Cosmos will not work. You
can simply fall back to ISO which should work with any environment.

###  ISO

The ISO option creates an ISO image of the Cosmos output. This ISO file can be
mounted and booted by most virtualization technologies. In addition a physical
optical disk can be burned and used to boot physical hardware.

###  VMWare Workstation

WMWare Workstation and VMWare Player are the preferred testing environments
for Cosmos. This is because they are stable, reliable, and easily controlled
by the Cosmos Visual Studio integration package. This second point provides
for a seemless development and debugging process.

VMWare Workstation is not free, however VMWare Player is. VMWare Player for
the typical Cosmos developer provides more than enough functionality.

###  VMWare Player
